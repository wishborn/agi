# orphan-check.sh — find unreferenced React components in ui/dashboard.
#
# Motivation: cycle 226-247 hit the SAME bug twice. A component-swap
# commit (Chat.tsx → PromptInput, ChannelSettings → Discord status card)
# landed in dead code because the targeted component was unreferenced
# anywhere else. typecheck + lint + build all passed; the swap simply
# never rendered. Owner only noticed during testing.
#
# This script greps every component file's basename across the dashboard
# source tree. Files with zero importers (excluding self + tests) are
# flagged. An allowlist of intentionally-archived components keeps the
# baseline clean.
#
# Exit status: 0 = no new orphans; 1 = new orphans found.
