/**
 * Route-map for default DevNotes.
 *
 * Owner directive (cycle 150, 2026-04-30): DevNotes lives on every page,
 * every tab, every view as a small embeddable component, with all notes
 * stacking to one global modal navigated by arrow keys.
 *
 * This file is the route-map fallback: every dashboard route gets at
 * least one default `<DevNote>` registration via `<RouteDevNotes>` in
 * root.tsx. Pages can ALSO embed inline `<DevNote>` components for
 * page-specific concerns; both register to the same global modal and
 * both show up under the icon's count.
 *
 * Routes are matched by prefix — the longest-matching prefix wins.
 * `/projects/foo` falls back to `/projects` if `/projects/foo` isn't
 * present in the map.
 *
 * Editing this file: add/update the entry for a route when there's
 * something specific the owner should know when testing that page on
 * production. "What to expect" is the litmus.
