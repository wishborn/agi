/**
 * Layer A + B memory schema (s112 t381) — schema-first slice.
 *
 * Per `_discovery/aion-blockchain-memory-draft-a.md`:
 *   Layer A — Working memory  (in-process; current task state)
 *   Layer B — Episodic memory (persisted with hash + confidence + provenance)
 *
 * This slice ships ONLY the type contracts + a canonical-hash helper +
 * a bridge to the AnchorRecord shape from `@agi/sdk` (Layer D, NoopAnchor
 * in v0.4.0 / live blockchain in v0.6.0). Storage migration (replacing
 * the flat `MemoryEntry` shape in agent-invoker.ts:540 with this richer
 * shape, plus the agi_data Postgres table updates) lands as a follow-up
 * slice under the same task — schema-first lets G4 (episode scoring)
 * + s117 (TrueCost integration) consume the type now without waiting on
 * the migration.
 *
 * Why a new file (not extending types.ts):
 *   - `MemoryEntry` is the legacy flat schema. Existing code consumes it
 *     directly. Mixing the new richer shape into the same file invites
 *     callers to grab the wrong type.
 *   - Episodic memory is conceptually distinct: every record carries a
 *     `coaFingerprint` tying it to the COA<>COI chain + a `primeAlignment`
 *     score (s112 G2 will populate this against PRIME). That's not what
 *     `MemoryEntry` captures.
 *   - Storage layer migration in slice 2 will eventually decide whether
 *     to merge the schemas or keep them separate. For now: separate.
