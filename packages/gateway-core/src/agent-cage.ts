/**
 * agent-cage — derives the path subtree a chat-bound tool invocation
 * is allowed to read/write/execute within.
 *
 * **s130 phase B (t515 slice 5, 2026-04-29):** the keystone security
 * primitive for chat tool caging. When a chat session has project
 * context attached, ITS TOOLS — including bash commands — are CAGED
 * to that project folder. Without this primitive, today's chat with
 * project context can shell-exec anywhere reachable by the gateway
 * process — a security surface that grows with every new project.
 *
 * **What this module does:**
 *   - `deriveCage(context)` — computes the allowed subtree(s) given a
 *     ToolExecutionContext. Returns null when no cage applies (e.g.
 *     no projectContext set; gateway-wide tool access).
 *   - `isPathInCage(path, cage)` — predicate the tool registry calls
 *     to gate fs/shell operations. Resolves path traversals (`..`)
 *     correctly so callers can't escape via relative tricks.
 *   - `requiresEscapePrompt(path, cage)` — when isPathInCage is false
 *     but the cage allows AskUserQuestion-gated escape (Q-6 owner
 *     answer), returns true so the agent-invoker fires an escape
 *     prompt before proceeding.
 *
 * **Cage structure** (from Q-6 owner answer 2026-04-28 + s126 ops-mode
 * pattern):
 *   - **Single-repo project (default):** allowed = [projectPath +
 *     {.agi, k, repos, .trash} subtrees]. Project's own source
 *     directly under projectPath/ is INCLUDED.
 *   - **Ops-mode project (category="ops"):** allowed = single-repo
 *     cage UNION all sibling projects' subtrees (per s126 cross-
 *     project tool access pattern).
 *   - **No project context:** cage = null → gateway-wide access
 *     (today's behavior, preserved for non-project-bound chats).
 *   - **AskUserQuestion gate:** when a path is OUTSIDE the cage,
 *     `requiresEscapePrompt` returns true; the agent-invoker is
 *     responsible for firing the prompt.
 *
 * Slice 6 wires this into the tool registry. This slice ships the
 * pure primitive + tests; it has no I/O and no globals.
