/**
 * chat-history-migration — moves project-scoped chat sessions from the
 * global `~/.agi/chat-history/` to per-project `<projectPath>/.ai/chat/`.
 *
 * **s130 t518 slice 1 (2026-04-29):** the smallest viable migration
 * primitive. Doesn't refactor ChatPersistence — that's a follow-up
 * slice. This module just provides a copy-only helper that
 * ProjectConfigManager / migrateProjectConfig can call when a project
 * gets migrated to its new layout.
 *
 * **What this does:**
 *   1. Walks `~/.agi/chat-history/` for `<id>.json` files
 *   2. For each, parses the session and checks `session.context`
 *   3. If `session.context === projectPath`, copies to
 *      `<projectPath>/.ai/chat/<id>.json` (idempotent — skip if target
 *      exists)
 *   4. Returns count of sessions migrated + per-session details
 *
 * **What this does NOT do:**
 *   - Delete the global session (preserved as backup; cleanup is a
 *     later slice once stable across upgrades)
 *   - Refactor ChatPersistence to be project-aware (that's slice 2 of
 *     t518 — readers still hit the global dir; sessions land at both
 *     locations during the transitional period)
 *   - Migrate non-project-scoped sessions (those stay global; only
 *     `session.context` matching `projectPath` are project-scoped)
 *
 * Per Q-3 (cycle 88 owner answer): per-project chat history lives at
 * `<projectPath>/.ai/chat/`, alongside .ai/plans, .ai/knowledge, .ai/pm, and
 * .ai/memory.
