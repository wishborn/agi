/**
 * aionima-system-migration — s119 t703.
 *
 * One-shot, idempotent migration that moves the Aionima fork repos
 * from their legacy flat layout (`<workspaceRoot>/_aionima/<name>`)
 * into the universal monorepo layout (`<workspaceRoot>/_aionima/repos/<name>`)
 * so `_aionima` becomes a single project per s119 t702.
 *
 * Owner directive 2026-05-09: hard-move + rewrite symlinks (one-shot
 * cutover). This module handles the disk side. The `~/temp_core/<name>`
 * Claude-Code-workspace symlinks (owner's local dev setup) are NOT
 * touched here — those are owner-side scaffolding, rewritten manually
 * after the migration runs.
 *
 * Sibling to project-config-shape-migration (s150 t632) and
 * mcp-config-migration (s131 t681). Same pattern: allow-listed names,
 * atomic mv per fork, idempotent.
 *
 * Safe to call repeatedly. Disk is only touched when something
 * actually changes. A fully-migrated install returns
 * `{ scanned: 11, moved: 0, alreadyMigrated: N, errors: [] }`.

/**
 * Move forks from legacy flat layout into `_aionima/repos/`. Idempotent
 * + atomic per fork.
 *
 * Pre-conditions:
 *   - `_aionima/repos/` already exists (created by t701 scaffolder)
 *   - Forks at the legacy location have a `.git/` dir (sanity check —
 *     otherwise we refuse to move because the dir is not a git repo)
 *
 * Post-conditions:
 *   - Each known fork lives at `_aionima/repos/<name>/`
 *   - Already-migrated forks unchanged
 *   - Forks not present in this install (e.g. fancy-3d / fancy-screens
 *     before they're cloned) skipped silently
 *
 * Errors are captured per-fork rather than thrown — partial migration
 * is preferable to total halt because operator inspection is needed
 * either way and we want to surface every issue at once.
