/**
 * Dev-Mode auth helpers — inject the owner's GitHub OAuth token into
 * outbound git URLs so owner forks clone over HTTPS without requiring SSH
 * keys.
 *
 * The token itself is read directly from the `connections` table (provider
 * `github`, role `owner`) by the caller in server-runtime-state.ts — AGI
 * owns identity natively now; there is no external identity service to call.
 * (Historically a `fetchOwnerToken()` helper here polled the retired Local-ID
 * service at id.ai.on; that path was absorbed into the gateway when Local-ID
 * was folded into AGI, so the helper was removed.)
 *
 * This module is **Dev-Mode only**. In production (dev disabled), the
 * clone paths use the original repoUrl unchanged.

/**
 * Inject the owner's token into a git URL so clones authenticate as the
 * fork owner. GitHub's convention: `https://x-access-token:TOKEN@host/...`.
 *
 * Handles three input shapes:
 *   - `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`  → inject credentials
 *   - `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`       → rewrite to HTTPS + inject (SSH
 *     → HTTPS fallback, tynn #253 — no SSH key required on the host)
 *   - Everything else                        → unchanged
 *
 * Returns the original URL unchanged if it already carries credentials
 * (authority contains `@` before the final host segment).
