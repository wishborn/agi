# Gateway State Machine

The gateway's operational state is a **read-only status** computed from AGI's connection to Aionima-prime and Hive-ID. It is not a setting. Any UI or config surface that lets a user "pick" a state is a bug.

## States

| State | Meaning | Common causes |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Initial** / **Unknown** | Boot has not yet resolved the state. Transient. | Gateway just started; peer probes haven't returned. |
| **Limbo** | Running locally, but local COA<>COI has not been validated with the **0PRIME Schema**. | The current expected steady state for every running Aionima — because 0PRIME (the Hive mind) is not yet operational. |
| **Offline** | PRIME corpus is unreachable (directory missing or gateway can't read it). PRIME lookups will fail downstream. | PRIME corpus directory (`~/.aionima/`) missing or unreadable. |
| **Online** | Everything aligned: local identity is HIVE-registered, local PRIME mirrors 0PRIME, COA<>COI validates against 0PRIME Schema. | Future — reachable only when 0PRIME comes up. Not achievable today. |

## State is audit-only, NOT a permission gate

**The state value is metadata, not access control.** It is stamped onto every action in the COA<>COI log so that — when $imp is eventually minted through 0PRIME — the chain carries integrity provenance: under what conditions (HIVE-aligned Online vs local-only Limbo vs degraded Offline) was this action performed?

What this means in practice:

- The agent's available tools are **NOT filtered by state**. `requiresState` on tool manifests is retained as a hint for logging / UI dimming, but the tool filter (`computeAvailableTools`) ignores it. Tools are filtered by `requiresTier` only.
- There is no "capabilities per state" table. The gateway does not disable remote ops, Tynn, memory, or deletions based on state. Downstream operations may fail naturally (e.g. PRIME corpus missing → knowledge lookups error) but that's a consequence of the real subsystem being unavailable, not of a state-based block.
- When $imp minting ships, the miner reads the logged state for each operation to weight integrity. Actions performed in Online carry more integrity than the same action in Limbo, and Offline actions require review before they're eligible for mint.

## 0PRIME

**0PRIME** is the Hive mind of Aionima — the distributed AI substrate and Impactium blockchain. It holds the canonical schema that local COA<>COI chains validate against. 0PRIME is not yet operational, which is why every running Aionima is currently in Limbo. When 0PRIME is available and a node's local state validates, the state machine transitions to Online.

## API surface

- `GET /api/gateway/state` — returns `{ state, capabilities }`. Read-only.
- `GET /api/system/connections` — returns detailed per-peer breakdown (AGI / prime / workspace). Dashboards use this for deeper diagnostics.
- `POST /api/gateway/restart` — graceful restart. Writes the shutdown marker, exits on SIGTERM, service supervisor brings the gateway back up.

## Dashboard surface

The Gateway card on Settings → Gateway → General shows the computed state as a colored pill and a **Restart gateway** button in place of what used to be a (misguided) "Initial State" select:

- **Limbo** — yellow pill
- **Offline** — red pill
- **Online** — green pill (future)
- **Initial** / **Unknown** — muted pill

The pill polls `GET /api/gateway/state` every 5 seconds while the settings page is open.

## Implementation

- Transition table + capabilities: `packages/gateway-core/src/state-machine.ts`.
- Boot-time initial value: `packages/gateway-core/src/server.ts` around line 327 (`new GatewayStateMachine(gw.state)`). The constructor argument is legacy — today the schema still accepts `gateway.state` for back-compat but it should be removed once all instances have migrated off. Follow-up: strip `state` from `GatewayConfigSchema` and pass `"UNKNOWN"` explicitly; the probes then drive all transitions.
- Peer probes that should drive transitions: `/api/system/connections` already does the probing work (see `agi` + `prime` + `workspace` status fields). Wiring probe results back into `stateMachine.transition(...)` is a separate refactor; right now state only changes when something inside the gateway explicitly calls `transition()`.

## Rule of thumb

When writing any code or UI that reads the state, treat it as a live computed value — never a stored config field. When writing any code that might "set" the state, think twice: only internal subsystems reacting to observable peer status should ever call `stateMachine.transition(...)`.
