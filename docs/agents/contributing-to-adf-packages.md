# Contributing to ADF Packages (PAx)

**Audience:** Aion + human contributors maintaining the eight
Particle-Academy packages that form the ADF UI primitive layer.

This document describes the **maintenance loop**: when AGI (or another
consumer) needs a primitive that doesn't exist yet, when a primitive has
a bug, or when a primitive needs a new variant — how that work gets done
without leaving local fallbacks scattered across the consumer.

---

## 1. The eight PAx packages

| Package | npm | What it provides |
|---|---|---|
| `react-fancy` | `@particle-academy/react-fancy` | React component library — Card, Tabs, AccordionPanel, Sidebar, Action, Field, Pillbox, Avatar, Tooltip, Popover, Dropdown, Modal, Editor, ContentRenderer, Canvas, Diagram, etc. |
| `fancy-code` | `@particle-academy/fancy-code` | Code editor / syntax highlighting (CodeMirror-backed). Powers the Editor sub-surface, file previews, terminal/log viewers. |
| `fancy-sheets` | `@particle-academy/fancy-sheets` | Data grid primitive — sortable columns, virtualization, click-to-expand rows, multi-select. Powers the Projects browser list view, dependency tables, tynn task lists. |
| `fancy-echarts` | `@particle-academy/fancy-echarts` | Charts on Apache ECharts — sparklines, Sankey, timeline, donut. Renamed from `react-echarts` upstream; npm rename pending (first work item). |
| `fancy-3d` | `@particle-academy/fancy-3d` | 3D scene and WebGL components (Three.js-backed). |
| `fancy-screens` | `@particle-academy/fancy-screens` | Full-screen layout primitives and screen transitions. |
| `fancy-whiteboard` | `@particle-academy/fancy-whiteboard` | Collaborative whiteboard canvas. |
| `agent-integrations` | `@particle-academy/agent-integrations` | Agent UI integration primitives. |

All eight live in this workspace as siblings to `agi/`:

| Symlink | Repo | Push origin | Upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/react-fancy` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/react-fancy` | `wishborn/react-fancy` | `Particle-Academy/react-fancy` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/fancy-code` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/fancy-code` | `wishborn/fancy-code` | `Particle-Academy/fancy-code` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/fancy-sheets` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/fancy-sheets` | `wishborn/fancy-sheets` | `Particle-Academy/fancy-sheets` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/fancy-echarts` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/fancy-echarts` | `wishborn/fancy-echarts` | `Particle-Academy/fancy-echarts` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/fancy-3d` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/fancy-3d` | `wishborn/fancy-3d` | `Particle-Academy/fancy-3d` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/fancy-screens` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/fancy-screens` | `wishborn/fancy-screens` | `Particle-Academy/fancy-screens` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/fancy-whiteboard` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/fancy-whiteboard` | `wishborn/fancy-whiteboard` | `Particle-Academy/fancy-whiteboard` |
| `~/temp_core/_aionima/repos/agent-integrations` | `/home/wishborn/_projects/_aionima/repos/agent-integrations` | `wishborn/agent-integrations` | `Particle-Academy/agent-integrations` |

Provisioned via the **Contributing Mode** toggle in
`Settings → Gateway → Contributing` (single source of truth:
`packages/gateway-core/src/dev-mode-forks.ts CORE_REPOS`). Never
`gh repo fork` manually — extend `CORE_REPOS` if a needed repo isn't
there.

---

## 2. Tynn surface — where the work lives

The **PAx domain** (slug: `pax`) holds maintenance work, with one
**feature** per package:

- `react-fancy`
- `fancy-code`
- `fancy-sheets`
- `fancy-echarts`
- `fancy-3d`
- `fancy-screens`
- `fancy-whiteboard`
- `agent-integrations`

When AGI needs a primitive that doesn't exist (or a bug fix to one that
does), file a **tynn story** under the relevant feature. The umbrella
domain pattern beats per-package projects because the four packages
evolve together — a Tabs change in `react-fancy` often pairs with a
syntax-highlighting tweak in `fancy-code`.

## 4. When NOT to file upstream

If the primitive need is genuinely AGI-specific (e.g., wraps a tynn
concept that wouldn't make sense in a general-purpose component
library), build it locally in `agi/ui/dashboard/src/components/ui/*`
instead. Examples already in tree:
- `dev-notes.tsx` (cycle 87) — a page-level dev-notes primitive that
  ADF-candidates but stayed local while the API stabilized.
- `panel-trigger.tsx`
- `stack-picker.tsx`

The deciding question: **would a different consumer of `react-fancy`
(plugin, MApp, locally-hosted app) want this primitive?** If yes →
upstream. If no → local. If unsure → start local, lift upstream when
a second consumer wants it.

---

## 5. Conventions (must follow)

- **Push origin only.** `git push origin <branch>` to wishborn fork.
  Never `git push upstream` to Particle-Academy. Cross-repo PR only.
- **Dev branch development.** Work on `dev` (or topic branches off
  dev). Never push to `main` on wishborn fork either — `main` is for
  upstream-merge syncs only.
- **Three same-commit guards** (mirror AGI conventions):
  typecheck, lint, tests. Each package has its own scripts; check
  `package.json`.
- **Version bumps in the same commit as the change.** Semver minor
  for new primitives, patch for bug fixes, major for breaking.
- **No silent local workarounds.** If you hit a bug AND can't fix
  upstream immediately, file the upstream issue first, then make a
  local workaround that imports from the published package and wraps.
  The workaround references the upstream issue in a comment so the
  cleanup path is discoverable later.

---

## 6. npm publish workflow

Particle-Academy uses **npm trusted publishers** (per the npm.com tab
the owner had open during cycle 88 setup). This means:

- **Don't run `npm publish` manually** on a PAx package. Trusted
  publishing happens via a GitHub Action triggered by a tag on the
  upstream `main` branch.
- The action validates the tag matches package.json's version, then
  publishes. No npm token sits on any developer machine.
- To publish: merge the PR upstream, tag the merge commit
  (`v<X.Y.Z>`), push the tag. Action does the rest.

If a publish fails: check the GitHub Actions log on the upstream repo,
not anywhere local.

## 7. Quick reference — common operations

### File a tynn story for a missing primitive

```
mcp__tynn__create({
  a: "story",
  title: "Tabs.WithBadge variant — count chip on tab labels",
  because: "MCPTab needs to surface 'open issues per tab' counts...",
  on: { feature_id: "<react-fancy feature ULID>" }
})
```

### Open a cross-repo PR

```bash
cd ~/temp_core/react-fancy
git checkout -b feat/tabs-with-badge
# implement + tests + version bump
git commit -am "Tabs.WithBadge variant + tests"
git push origin feat/tabs-with-badge
gh pr create --repo Particle-Academy/react-fancy \
  --base main --head wishborn:feat/tabs-with-badge \
  --title "Tabs.WithBadge variant" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Adds Tabs.WithBadge for surfacing counts on tab labels.

## Summary
- New Tabs.WithBadge variant: count chip on the tab label
- Storybook story + tests
- No breaking changes

## Test plan
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Storybook renders the variant
- [x] Visual regression snapshots updated
EOF
)"
```

### Bump consumer to a new PAx version

```bash
cd ~/temp_core/agi/ui/dashboard
# Edit package.json → bump the @particle-academy/<repo> version
pnpm install --filter @agi/dashboard
# Verify imports still typecheck:
cd ~/temp_core/agi && pnpm typecheck
# Bump agi version + commit + push + agi upgrade
```

### List currently installed PAx versions

```bash
cd ~/temp_core/agi/ui/dashboard
grep -E "@particle-academy/" package.json
```

**Status:** s136 t520 (cycle 89). The first concrete work item this
loop will execute end-to-end is the npm rename
`@particle-academy/react-echarts → @particle-academy/fancy-echarts`
(GitHub repo rename is upstream-complete; only the npm package rename
remains).
