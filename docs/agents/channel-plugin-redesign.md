# Channel Plugin Redesign — Design Doc

**Status:** Draft for owner sign-off.
**Owner directive:** 2026-05-13 — "a lot has changed since we first designed the channel plugins, it will need to be updated."
**Scope:** Replace the current `@agi/channel-sdk` shape with a redesigned contract that treats each channel as a **full application** (Intelligence Protocol + management UI + room model + project-binding + project-page surface), not just an event adapter.

This document is the spec the implementation tiers will build against. Nothing in here is shipped yet. Approve / amend / reject section-by-section.

---

## 1. Context — what changed since the originals

The current channel adapters (`channels/discord`, `channels/telegram`, `channels/signal`, `channels/whatsapp`, `channels/gmail`) predate every one of these system shifts:

| Subsystem | When formalized | Affects channels how |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **ADF — Agent Development Framework** | 2026-04 onward | Channels are sensory inputs to the agent; should look like Intelligence Protocols (MPx is the first), not standalone plugins |
| **agent-integrations + MicroMcpServer** | 2026-04-30 onward (s142, s157 PAx onboarding) | The bridge-per-session + tool-host pattern is now canonical for "agent-driven UI surfaces." Channel sessions fit this shape exactly |
| **MApps** | s127, s152, s157 + Magic Apps editor | Channels need to be MApp-composable so authors can wire workflows to channel events |
| **Provider abstraction** | s111 cycle 142 onward | Hot-swappable, multi-instance, settings-card pattern Channels should mirror |
| **Project cage** | s130 t515 cycle 71 onward | Chat tools cage to project context; channel-bound events must participate |
| **Pending entities + COA<>COI** | aionima-id matured, Hive-ID still pending | Channel-side users get tentative entity IDs that owner promotes |
| **Iterative-work loops + tynn workflow** | s118 + iterative-work.md | Channel events can fire iterative-work cycles bound to channel-resident projects |
| **PRIME Intelligence Protocols** | mycelium.md formalized | Channels should plug into the same protocol class MPx defines |

The redesign reconciles channels with all eight.

---

## 2. The Channel-as-Application thesis

A channel adapter, redesigned, is **a self-contained application** that owns five surfaces:

1. **Protocol surface** — implements `IntelligenceProtocol`. Inbound message events flow with COA<>COI tagging; outbound replies route the same way.
2. **Bridge surface** — a `MicroMcpServer`-style host that exposes the channel's primitives (`post`, `search_messages`, `get_user`, `list_rooms`, …) as MCP tools other code (agent, MApp, plugin) can call.
3. **Management UI surface** — its own React surface mounted at `/settings/channels/<id>`. The channel plugin ships its config form, server/workspace picker, role inspector, intent toggles, hot-reload buttons. Not gateway-owned.
4. **Project-page UI surface** — a React component the plugin exports, slotted into `ProjectDetail.tsx` when the project has at least one room bound to this channel. Renders the channel's view of that room (threads, messages, composer).
5. **Room abstraction** — exposes a unified `listRooms` / `getRoom` / `subscribeRoom` / `postToRoom` interface that hides the channel's native primitives (Discord forums, Slack channels, Telegram chats, Email mailboxes) behind one contract.

Everything else in the system composes against these five surfaces. The gateway no longer special-cases "discord" or "telegram" — it just iterates registered channels.

---

## 3. The `defineChannel` contract

Public SDK in `@agi/aion-sdk`:

```ts
import type { ReactElement, ComponentType } from "react";

/** A room inside a channel. Maps to Discord forum/channel/DM, Slack channel,
 *  Telegram chat/group/channel, Email mailbox/label, etc. Channel-specific
 *  encoding lives in `roomId` (free-form string); the plugin parses it. */
export interface ChannelRoom {
  /** Channel-scoped unique id (e.g. "1234567890:forum:42" for Discord). */
  roomId: string;
  /** Human-readable label (e.g. "#general", "Bug Reports forum"). */
  label: string;
  /** What kind of room this is (channel-specific vocabulary). */

  activity?: string;
}

export interface ChannelMessage {

   * hard-coding per-channel knowledge.
   *
   * - **"enumerable"** — stable, complete room list (Discord, Slack).
   *   `listRooms()` returns the full set; a room picker works.
   * - **"seen-rooms"** — rooms appear only after a message arrives from an
   *   unknown contact (Telegram private, WhatsApp, Signal).
   *   `listRooms()` returns rooms seen so far. Room picker shows:
   *   "Rooms appear as contacts message you."
   * - **"category-based"** — rooms are structural categories native to the
   *   channel (Gmail labels, email folders).
   *   `listRooms()` returns the category list, NOT individual conversations.
   *
   * `dynamicRooms: true` (seen-rooms channels only) signals that external
   * senders can create new rooms by messaging the bot.
   */

The `defineChannel` builder:

```ts
import { defineChannel } from "@agi/aion-sdk";

export default defineChannel({
  id: "discord",
  displayName: "Discord",
  createProtocol: (ctx) => new DiscordProtocol(ctx),
  SettingsPage: DiscordSettingsPage,
  ProjectPagePanel: DiscordProjectPanel,
  bridgeTools: [discordPostMessage, discordSearchMessages, discordGetUser, discordListMembers, discordAggregateStats],
  readPolicy: {
    canReadAllMessages: { configurable: true, defaultOn: false },
    canReadPresence: { configurable: true, defaultOn: false },
    canReadRoles: { configurable: true, defaultOn: true },
    nativeIntents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "MessageContent", "GuildMembers", "GuildPresences", "DirectMessages"],
  },
});
```

## 4. Room abstraction — per-channel mapping

How each of the existing 5 channels maps its native vocabulary to `ChannelRoom`:

| Channel | Native concept | `kind` | `roomId` encoding | Notable `meta` |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Discord** | Forum channel | `forum` | `<guildId>:forum:<channelId>` | `archivedCount`, `appliedTags` |
| **Discord** | Forum thread | `thread` | `<guildId>:forum:<channelId>:thread:<threadId>` | `parentRoomId` = forum, `appliedTags`, `archived` |
| **Discord** | Text channel | `channel` | `<guildId>:channel:<channelId>` | `topic`, `slowmode` |
| **Discord** | DM | `dm` | `dm:<userId>` | n/a |
| **Slack** | Channel | `channel` | `<teamId>:channel:<channelId>` | `topic`, `purpose`, `isPrivate` |
| **Slack** | DM | `dm` | `<teamId>:dm:<userId>` | n/a |
| **Slack** | Group DM | `group` | `<teamId>:mpdm:<conversationId>` | `members` |
| **Telegram** | Private chat | `dm` | `private:<chatId>` | n/a |
| **Telegram** | Group | `group` | `group:<chatId>` | `memberCount`, `inviteLink` |
| **Telegram** | Supergroup | `group` | `supergroup:<chatId>` | `memberCount`, topic for forum-style |
| **Telegram** | Channel (broadcast) | `channel` | `channel:<chatId>` | `subscriberCount` |
| **WhatsApp** | 1:1 chat | `dm` | `dm:<contactPhoneE164>` | n/a |
| **WhatsApp** | Group | `group` | `group:<groupJid>` | `groupSubject`, `participants` |
| **Email (Gmail)** | Mailbox / label | `label` | `gmail:<labelName>` | `messageCount`, `unreadCount` |
| **Email (Gmail)** | Thread | `thread` | `gmail:thread:<threadId>` | `parentRoomId` = label, `subjectLine` |
| **Signal** | 1:1 | `dm` | `dm:<accountUuid>` | n/a |
| **Signal** | Group | `group` | `group:<groupV2Id>` | `memberCount`, `groupName` |

This is the unified contract callers see. Plugin internals translate.

### Room discovery models

Channels are NOT all the same — most do not share a Discord-like "list all channels in a guild" primitive. Each channel declares its discovery model in `ChannelDefinition.roomDiscovery` so callers (room picker, project binding UI) can adapt without hard-coding channel-specific knowledge.

| Channel | `roomDiscovery.model` | `dynamicRooms` | Room picker UX |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Discord** | `"enumerable"` | — | Full list; user picks from tree |
| **Slack** | `"enumerable"` | — | Full list; user picks from list |
| **Telegram** | `"seen-rooms"` | `true` | "Rooms appear as contacts message you" |
| **WhatsApp** | `"seen-rooms"` | `true` | "Rooms appear as contacts message you" |
| **Signal** | `"seen-rooms"` | `true` | "Rooms appear as contacts message you" |
| **Gmail** | `"category-based"` | — | Label/folder picker (static, no individual threads) |

**Model semantics:**
- **`"enumerable"`** — `listRooms()` returns the stable full set. Room picker works conventionally.
- **`"seen-rooms"`** — `listRooms()` returns only rooms seen so far (populated as messages arrive). The set grows at runtime. Room picker shows a notice: *"Rooms appear as contacts message you."*
- **`"category-based"`** — `listRooms()` returns structural categories (Gmail labels), NOT individual conversations. Messages within a category arrive via the category's `roomId`. Room picker shows the category list.

When `roomDiscovery` is absent, callers default to `"enumerable"` for backwards compatibility.

---

## 5. Project ↔ Room binding

### Data model

Each project's `project.json` gains a `rooms[]` array:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "blackorchid-web",
  "type": "web",
  // ... existing fields ...
  "rooms": [
    { "channelId": "discord", "roomId": "1234567890:forum:42",       "label": "Bug Reports" },
    { "channelId": "discord", "roomId": "1234567890:channel:99",     "label": "#deploys" },
    { "channelId": "slack",   "roomId": "T0A1/channel:C0B2",         "label": "#blackorchid-team" },
    { "channelId": "gmail",   "roomId": "gmail:project/blackorchid", "label": "blackorchid@civicognita" }
  ]
}
```

- **Multi-binding** is the default. A project can have a Discord forum + Slack channel + Email label simultaneously.
- **`label`** is the user's friendly name for this binding, possibly different from the channel's native room label.
- **Channel plugins ARE NOT consulted** to validate the binding at config-write time — gateway resolves room existence lazily via `protocol.getRoom()` on first read. A stale binding (room deleted, plugin offline) renders an "unreachable" state in the UI.

### Resolution flow

1. **Event arrives** → channel protocol emits `ChannelEvent` with `roomId`.
2. **Gateway dispatcher** queries `findProjectByRoom(channelId, roomId)` (indexed lookup against the union of all `project.json.rooms[]`).
3. If matched: event runs in that project's context — cage applies, project-scoped tools available, COA chain tagged with `projectPath`.
4. If unmatched: event runs in the global / no-project context (same as today's chat-without-project).

### Project Settings UI

A new tab on `ProjectDetail.tsx` (probably "Channels" under the Coordinate mode):

- Lists current bindings as cards
- "+ Bind a room" button → channel picker → room picker (calls `protocol.listRooms()` for the chosen channel) → label input → save
- Per-binding: edit label, remove binding, view "last activity" timestamp

### Project Page Panel

When at least one room is bound for any channel, the channel plugin's `ProjectPagePanel` renders on the project page. The panel receives:

```ts
interface ChannelProjectPanelProps {
  projectPath: string;
  /** All this project's bindings for THIS channel (channel filtered). */
  bindings: Array<{ roomId: string; label: string }>;
  /** Bridge host the panel can call tools on. */
  bridge: McpToolHost;
}
```

Discord's panel renders forum thread list / message log / composer per binding. Slack's renders channel timeline. Email's renders thread list with unread badges. Each plugin owns the UX completely.

---

## 6. Channel-internal management page

Mount path: `/settings/channels/<id>` (e.g. `/settings/channels/discord`). Added to the existing Settings sidebar.

Surface (channel-specific; below is Discord as the worked example):

- **Connection card** — bot token + application ID (sealed in `~/.agi/secrets/`), reload button, current connection state (ready / connecting / error)
- **Server (Guild) picker** — list of guilds the bot is in, with member count + role count
- **Intents** — checkboxes per intent (`MessageContent`, `GuildMembers`, `GuildPresences`) with explanations + Discord developer-portal link
- **Read policy** — per-guild `canReadAllMessages` + `canReadPresence` + `canReadRoles` toggles
- **Role-to-workflow bindings** — table of `<role> → <workflow>` rules (e.g. "Intern" → "onboarding.mapp", "Client" → "client-intake.mapp"). Per the owner directive 2026-05-12 ("I might have a role called Intern or Client, and this gives that user an ability to create a user account with this setup even if they can't access local-id"). The "create-user-account" path produces a `pending-from-discord` entity (Tier 4 work, separate doc).
- **Aion bot identity** — display name, avatar, accent color
- **Audit log** — recent inbound/outbound message volume, error rate, last-N events

Same pattern for Slack (workspace + scopes), Telegram (bot config + group allowlist), Email (OAuth account + label mapping), WhatsApp (number + group join). Each plugin's settings page owns its UX entirely.

---

## 7. Bridge tool registration

Every channel plugin registers a family of MCP tools (auto-namespaced with channel id). These show up in:

- **Agent tool registry** — Aion can call `discord_search_messages` when chat originates from Discord context.
- **MApp Magic Apps Editor** — workflow steps can use any registered bridge tool.
- **`agi` CLI** under `agi channel discord post …` (cross-cutting CLI subcommand).

Discord's bridge-tool set (worked example):

```ts
const discordBridgeTools: ChannelBridgeToolDefinition[] = [
  defineBridgeTool({
    name: "post_message",
    description: "Post a message to a Discord room (channel / forum thread / DM).",
    input: { roomId: "string", text: "string", replyToMessageId: "string?" },
    handler: async (input, ctx) => ctx.protocol.postToRoom(input.roomId, { text: input.text, replyToMessageId: input.replyToMessageId }),
  }),
  defineBridgeTool({ name: "search_messages", ... }),
  defineBridgeTool({ name: "get_user", ... }),
  defineBridgeTool({ name: "list_members", ... }),
  defineBridgeTool({ name: "list_rooms", ... }),
  defineBridgeTool({ name: "get_user_activity", ... }),
  defineBridgeTool({ name: "aggregate_stats", description: "Roll up message activity per user over a timeframe — for leaderboards.", ... }),
];
```

The `aggregate_stats` tool is what Aion-as-scrum-master uses for check-in leaderboards + screenshot-count awards.

---

## 8. Cage + entity flow

### Cage

When a room-bound event arrives:

1. Dispatcher resolves `findProjectByRoom(channelId, roomId)` → projectPath
2. `cageProvider(roomId)` returns the project's cage (same shape as today's chat cage — `[projectPath, projectPath/k, projectPath/repos, projectPath/.agi, projectPath/.trash]`)
3. Agent tools run inside that cage exactly as if the chat had originated from the project's dashboard chat surface

### Entity binding

Channel `userId` → Aionima entity resolution:

```ts
async function resolveEntity(channelId: string, userId: string): Promise<{ entityId: string; isPending: boolean }> {
  // 1. Look up existing mapping in entity registry
  const known = await entityRegistry.findByChannel({ channelId, channelUserId: userId });
  if (known) return { entityId: known.entityId, isPending: known.isPending };

  // 2. Auto-create a pending entity
  const pending = await entityRegistry.createPending({
    source: `pending-from-${channelId}`,
    channelUserId: userId,
    displayName: await protocol.getUser(userId).then((u) => u?.displayName ?? userId),
  });
  return { entityId: pending.entityId, isPending: true };
}
```

`pending-from-<channel>` entities are stored locally, COA-tagged but not signed. Owner approves them in the dashboard's "Pending registrations" surface (separate doc — `pending-entity-flow.md`, future). Approved entities get promoted: pending → verified-on-local-id (or eventually hive-id).

---

## 9. Migration plan for the 5 existing adapters

Today's adapters: `channels/discord`, `channels/telegram`, `channels/signal`, `channels/whatsapp`, `channels/gmail` against `@agi/channel-sdk@0.1`.

Phased migration:

| Phase | Scope | Adapter(s) | Cycles |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **0** | Land the new SDK contract in `@agi/aion-sdk`. Old SDK stays alongside for compatibility | (none) | 1-2 |
| **1** | First rewrite — **Discord** — full new shape. Validates the design against the most-featured channel first | discord | 3-5 |
| **2** | Surface in dashboard — settings route, project-page slot, project-binding tab | (gateway-side) | 2-3 |
| **3** | Migrate **Telegram** + **Email** in parallel (simpler shapes) | telegram, gmail | 2-3 each |
| **4** | Migrate **Slack** + **WhatsApp** + **Signal** — added as new under the new shape (Slack is net-new; WhatsApp + Signal currently scaffold-only) | slack, whatsapp, signal | 2-3 each |
| **5** | Deprecate + remove `@agi/channel-sdk@0.1` | (cleanup) | 1 |

**Total: 16-25 cycles.** Discord lands first because (a) owner explicitly wants it back online with the new vision, (b) it has every shape we need to validate (forums, threads, DMs, roles, presence, voice), and (c) any contract gaps surface there before the cheap migrations.

**During Phase 1:** Discord's existing adapter stays on disk but `enabled: false` in config. The new Discord plugin lives at `channels/discord-v2/` (or replaces in-place on a feature branch). Once Phase 2 settings UX lands, owner flips a config switch to use the new one.

## 10. Open questions — owner answers (2026-05-13)

Eight of ten OQs answered via AskUserQuestion on 2026-05-13. OQ-9 + OQ-10 deferred per §12 (out-of-scope).

| # | Decision | **Owner answer** |
|---|----------|------------------|
| **OQ-1** | Multi-binding default for project-page Channels UI | **Unified Channels tab with channel sections.** One tab on Coordinate mode; channels with bindings render as sections inside. |
| **OQ-2** | Read-all-messages consent scope | **Per-room toggle with bot-presence implying consent on public channels.** Private rooms / DMs require explicit per-room toggle. |
| **OQ-3** | Pending-entity owner approval surface | **New page at `/identity/pending` with nav badge.** Sidebar shows red dot + count when count > 0. Per-row approve / reject / defer. |
| **OQ-4** | Channel-tool exposure rules | **Project-binding-based.** When chat's project context has at least one Discord room bound in `project.json.rooms[]`, `discord_*` tools register on the agent invoker for that chat. |
| **OQ-5** | Scrum-master skill scope | **Cross-channel skill using bridge-tool primitives.** Single `prompts/skills/scrum-master.md`; calls `<channel>_aggregate_stats` generically; Aion picks the right tool based on bound rooms. |
| **OQ-6** | Where role/channel-bound workflows live | **Plugin Marketplace MApp first.** Workflows are MApps from the marketplace. Settings binds `role:Intern → mapp:onboarding`. Per-project overrides deferred to Phase 4+. |
| **OQ-7** | ChannelProtocol vs IntelligenceProtocol shape | **Parallel interfaces, share COA tagging only.** No literal subclassing. Channels can evolve independent of MPx's shape. |
| **OQ-8** | Per-project channel-credentials override | **One bot per channel globally, no per-project override** for Phase 1. Per-project bots deferred. |
| OQ-9 | Voice + audio support | **Deferred** per §12. Audio attachments only this phase. |
| OQ-10 | Channel marketplace category | **Deferred.** Core 5 ship with agi; channel marketplace category considered later. |

## 11. Implementation tiers

Once this design doc is signed off, work decomposes into tynn stories:

| Story | Scope | Cycles |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **CHN-A: SDK contract** | `defineChannel` + `ChannelProtocol` + `ChannelRoom` + `ChannelEvent` + `ChannelDefinition` in `@agi/aion-sdk`; `@agi/channel-sdk@0.2` deprecation plan | 1-2 |
| **CHN-B: Discord rewrite** | Full new Discord plugin against new SDK. Includes management settings page, project-page panel, bridge tools, room mapping, intent toggles | 3-5 |
| **CHN-C: Gateway dispatcher** | `findProjectByRoom` index, cage binding, entity resolver, event-bus routing | 2-3 |
| **CHN-D: Project-binding UI** | `project.json` `rooms[]` schema, Coordinate-mode Channels tab, room picker dialog | 2-3 |
| **CHN-E: Pending-entity flow** | `pending-from-<channel>` entity state, owner-approval page, promotion to verified-on-local-id | 2-3 |
| **CHN-F: Role → workflow binding** | Channel settings page table + runtime resolver | 1-2 |
| **CHN-G: Scrum-master skill** | `prompts/skills/scrum-master.md` + `aggregate_stats` bridge tool family | 1-2 |
| **CHN-H: Discord-bridge MApp scaffold** | `defineDiscordWorkflow` example + Magic Apps Editor support | 2-3 |
| **CHN-I: Telegram migration** | Apply new SDK to existing telegram adapter | 2-3 |
| **CHN-J: Email migration** | Apply new SDK to existing gmail adapter | 2-3 |
| **CHN-K: Slack** | New under new SDK (currently scaffold-only) | 2-3 |
| **CHN-L: WhatsApp + Signal** | New under new SDK (currently scaffold-only) | 2-3 each |
| **CHN-M: Old SDK removal** | Deprecate + delete `@agi/channel-sdk@0.1` | 1 |

**Total — 26-39 cycles** across the channel-redesign epic. CHN-A through CHN-G is the MVP (delivers Discord-back-up + all the owner's directives: project-binding, role/channel workflow association, pending-entity flow, scrum-master, MApp authoring). Phases I-M are migration debt cleanup.

---

## 12. Out of scope (called out so owner doesn't expect them in this doc)

- **Voice channels + voice messages** — Discord/WhatsApp support voice; deferred to its own design doc.
- **End-to-end encrypted channels** — Signal especially. Crypto handling needs its own design discussion.
- **Channel-as-output for notifications** — Aionima already has a notifications system; channels-as-notification-destinations is a tangential concern handled by the existing notification routing.
- **AI moderation features** — content filtering, spam detection, etc. Out of scope for the redesign.
- **Cross-channel handoff** — same conversation flowing from Discord into a dashboard chat into Email, etc. Future work.
- **Multi-tenant channel-per-org** — Aionima today is single-owner. Multi-org channel access is a Hive-ID-era concern.

## 13. Ratification

§10 owner answers locked 2026-05-13. Remaining sections need explicit owner sign-off before their tier ships:

- [ ] §2 — Channel-as-Application thesis
- [ ] §3 — `defineChannel` SDK contract *(blocks CHN-A)* — **VALIDATED IN PRACTICE:** CHN-B (s163), CHN-C (s164), CHN-D (s165), CHN-E (s166), CHN-F (s167), CHN-G (s168) all shipped against v2 contract. Formal owner sign-off pending (Q-18 in pending-questions.mdc).*
- [ ] §4 — Room abstraction per-channel mapping *(blocks CHN-A)* — **VALIDATED IN PRACTICE:** Discord room mapping live in channels/discord/src/channel-def.ts + state.ts; CHN-D (s165) project-binding UI consumes it.*
- [ ] §5 — Project ↔ Room binding contract *(blocks CHN-D)* — **SHIPPED:** project.json rooms[] schema + Channels tab + room picker (CHN-D s165, v0.4.702).*
- [ ] §6 — Channel-internal management page *(blocks settings UI work)* — **PARTIALLY:** ChannelSettings in settings-gateway.tsx is the working fallback; ChannelDefinition.SettingsPage component injection into the dashboard deferred.*
- [x] §7 — Bridge tool family *(shipped: discord_aggregate_stats, discord_available_rooms, discord_message_history, discord_user_info, discord_list_members — CHN-B s163 + CHN-G s168 v0.4.709)*
- [ ] §8 — Cage + entity flow *(blocks CHN-E)* — **PARTIALLY SHIPPED:** /identity/pending page + approval queue + Local-ID promotion flow (CHN-E s166, v0.4.707); full cage binding for channel events deferred.*
- [ ] §9 — Migration plan (5 adapters, 6 phases)
- [x] §10 — Open questions answered (8/10; OQ-9 + OQ-10 deferred per §12)
- [ ] §11 — Implementation tier breakdown

## 14. What's unblocked now (post-OQ answers)

With OQ-1 through OQ-8 answered + §10 ratified, the implementation tiers split into:

**Unblocked — can start in any order:**
- **CHN-E** (pending-from-discord entity flow) — `/identity/pending` page + nav badge + entity-registry extension. OQ-3 + OQ-7 answered.
- **CHN-G** (scrum-master skill) — `prompts/skills/scrum-master.md` cross-channel + `discord_aggregate_stats` bridge tool. OQ-5 answered.
- **CHN-F** (role/channel → workflow binding) — Marketplace MApp resolver + Settings UI. OQ-6 answered.

**Still gated on §3 + §4 sign-off (SDK contract + room abstraction):**
- CHN-A, CHN-B (full Discord rewrite), CHN-C, CHN-D, CHN-I-M (other channel migrations).

CHN-B partial already shipped as v0.4.661 against the old SDK — privileged intents + 4 bridge tools. The remaining CHN-B work (room-model + `defineChannel` contract) waits on §3 sign-off.
